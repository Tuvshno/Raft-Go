# Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation
## Overview
This project is an ongoing implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm, a robust and easy-to-understand protocol for achieving consensus in distributed systems. The goal of this project is to build a fully functioning Raft-based system from scratch using Go, ensuring that all key aspects of the algorithm—leader election, log replication, and safety guarantees—are correctly implemented.

## Current Progress
- Protocol Buffers : Defined the message formats and RPC interfaces required for communication between nodes. This includes the structure for key messages such as RequestVote, AppendEntries, and Heartbeat that are essential for leader election and log replication.

- Server Initialization : Implemented the basic structure of a Raft node, including the initialization of servers, handling incoming RPC requests, and maintaining the state necessary for consensus. The server is equipped to start participating in the consensus process, including handling votes and appending log entries.

- Main Execution : Set up the main execution flow, which involves starting the Raft nodes, initializing the cluster, and managing the communication between nodes. The groundwork for the core algorithm has been laid out, with initial steps towards leader election and log replication in place.

## Remaining Tasks
- Leader Election: While the basic structure for handling RequestVote RPCs is in place, the logic for robust leader election, including vote counting and term management, is still in progress.

- Log Replication: The framework for appending entries to the log has been set up, but the full mechanism for log consistency, including the management of the log index and ensuring all followers replicate the log correctly, needs further development.

- Commit and Apply Logs: The system currently needs the implementation of mechanisms to commit logs to the state machine and apply those changes. This is critical for ensuring that the system maintains consistency even in the presence of failures.

- Persistence and Recovery: Implementing persistence to disk is crucial for making the system resilient to crashes. Currently, this aspect is in the planning phase.

- Testing and Validation: Comprehensive testing is required to validate the correctness of the Raft implementation, particularly in scenarios involving network partitions, leader failures, and recovery.

## What I Learned So Far
This project has significantly deepened my understanding of distributed consensus algorithms. In particular, I gained insights into:

- RPC Communication: Utilizing Protocol Buffers and gRPC to manage communication between distributed nodes, ensuring efficient and reliable message passing.

- State Management: Implementing the internal state machine that underlies Raft, managing different states such as Follower, Candidate, and Leader.

- Concurrency in Distributed Systems: Handling the concurrency challenges that arise in a distributed environment, particularly in coordinating actions across multiple nodes while ensuring the system remains consistent and available.

As this project progresses, the focus will be on completing the leader election and log replication mechanisms, ensuring robust consensus in the presence of failures. Additionally, I plan to implement persistence and recovery to handle real-world scenarios where nodes may crash and restart.

Beyond that, there are many exciting opportunities for further development. I intend to explore and implement advanced concurrency patterns to enhance the system's performance and scalability. I also plan to deploy this implementation on Kubernetes, allowing for automated management, scaling, and deployment across a cluster of machines. These steps will not only improve the system's robustness but also prepare it for real-world use cases where distributed consensus is critical.
